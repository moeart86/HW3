	//A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. 
	//The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. 
	//It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:


	  int modelYear;
	  String carName;
	  int x;  // Create a class attribute

	  // Create a class constructor for the constructor class
	  public Constructors(int year, String name ) {//you can have 
		  x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
		  modelYear = year;
		  carName = name;
		  
	  }
