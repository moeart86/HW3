package Introduction;
//Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

//Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
//An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:
	
abstract class abstracton {
	  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
	  public abstract void animalSound();
	  // Regular method
	  public void sleep() {
	    System.out.println("Zzz");
	  }
	
	

	

	
	
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
	}
